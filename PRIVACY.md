# Privacy

Let's keep this simple: by default, no user data is collected.

However, in order for this bot to function (for only some of its features!), I need to store some information about you.

In case new features are added and more data needs to be stored, this document will be updated.

## Data I store

For all features related to 'events', the following data is stored:

- **Discord ID**: I need to store this so I can link both responses and event IDs to you!
- **"Response"** (going/not-going/maybe/lft/selling): I need to store this so I know what you responded with. 
- **event ID**: I need to store this so I know which events you responded to.

## Your rights

Want your data removed? Click **'Revoke & Delete'** after using `/privacy` and data related to you will be deleted from the database.

Note: your data might temporarily exist in a database back-up.  

## Concerns

Please DM me on Discord
